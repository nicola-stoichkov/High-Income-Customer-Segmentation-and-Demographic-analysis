# üìä High-Income Customer Segmentation & Demographic Analysis

# üìå About the Project
This project focuses on identifying and segmenting high-income customers using demographic and geographic data from the AdventureWorks dataset. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can support targeted marketing strategies, particularly through location-based personalization.

By analyzing customer income, demographics, and geographic distribution, the project highlights the top 10 cities with the highest density of high-income customers ‚Äî enabling more strategic and effective marketing initiatives.

# üéØ Objectives

‚úÖ Demonstrate end-to-end data analysis by simulating a real business scenario.

‚úÖ Identify and profile high-income customers to support marketing personalization.

‚úÖ Showcase the use of Azure cloud services for enterprise data analytics.

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Stack Used (Azure Ecosystem)

This project replicates an enterprise-grade data analytics workflow fully deployed on Microsoft Azure:

 - __Azure Storage__:	Hosted source .csv files.

 - __Azure SQL Server & Database__:	Stored and managed data tables (DimCustomer, DimGeography).

 - __Azure Data Factory__:	Created pipelines to load data from Blob Storage into SQL Database.

 - __Azure Data Studio__:	Used for SQL querying and data exploration.

 - __Power BI Desktop__:	Visualized insights by directly connecting to the Azure SQL Database.

# üß† Methodology

__1. Resource Deployment & Data Wrangling__
 - Deployed Azure resources: SQL Server, Blob Storage, and SQL Database.

 - Uploaded raw .csv data to Azure Blob Storage.

 - Created tables in the SQL Database.

 - Built Data Factory pipelines to automate data loading (ETL).

__1.1 Cleaned data by:__

 - Identifying and dropping high-null or irrelevant columns.

 - Ensuring join keys were intact.

__2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)__
 - Ran descriptive statistics on numeric fields.

 - Analyzed distributions of categorical variables.

 - Performed correlation analysis (Pearson) to identify feature relationships.

__3. Business Intelligence (BI) Analysis__

Built SQL views and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to extract business insights:

 - üìç Top 10 States/Provinces with highest concentration of high-income customers.
   
 - üìç Top 10 Cities enriched with demographic features (e.g., education, marital status, gender).

__4. Visualization__
Created a Power BI dashboard featuring:

 - Bar Charts showing high-income customer distribution by City and State.

 - Tables displaying demographic breakdown of high-value customer clusters.
